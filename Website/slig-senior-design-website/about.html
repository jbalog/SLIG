                    <p align="justify">Ramon Santana is a first generation, electrical engineer student at the University of Central Florida. He has maintained leadership presence on campus in numerous ways. Santana was a Teaching Assistant for two engineering classes. Currently, Santana is a Peer Mentor and Peer Tutor for engineering students at the office of PRIME STEM at UCF. Santana is the Mentoring Program Coordinator for the Society of Hispanic and Professional Engineers at UCF. Santana is also a brother of Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity Incorporated. During the summer of 2015, Santana did an internship for NextEra Energy as a Protection and Control Engineer. His responsibilities at that time were to make sure that all the equipment inside transmission and distribution substations were working and functioning properly; by performing maintenance on feeder breakers, calibrating relays, completing trip by lockouts and much more. His hands-on experience and leadership skills were a significant contribution to the implementation of the SLIG. He was responsible for the powering, charging and the wireless communication of our project. After UCF, Santana will continue working for NextEra Energy as a Distribution Engineer.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Emmanuel Hernandez is an electrical engineering undergraduate student.  He has been a mathematics tutor at the UCF Mathematics Assistance & Learning Lab (MALL) since 2012, and has completed 3 semesters of internships with two different companies.  During the first internship at The Walt Disney Company, Emmanuel was given the opportunity to work with programmable logic controllers (PLC).  In this time he gained his first experiences with control systems, although it doesnâ€™t have much to do with microcontrollers.  About a year later, he was given the opportunity to participate in an internship at Florida Power & Light Company, where he was given the opportunity to work with microprocessor relays and get more of an experience with control logic, and this time a little more in-depth in the microprocessor side of control systems.  This being said, Emmanuel was responsible for the control system aspect of the Sign Language Interpreter Glove.  In the building and implementation part of the project, he was responsible for programming the microcontroller to make decisions on what hand gestures are currently being performed.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Christopher Delgado is a first generation electrical engineering undergraduate student at the University of Central Florida. He has been part of the Burnett Honors College since the beginning. Since the summer semester of 2015, he has been working as a System Performance intern for Verizon Wireless and has gained valuable experience in networking. Prior to his internship with Verizon, Christopher worked as a tutor for the SDES TRIO Center in UCF where he helped other students improve their performance in their physics, calculus and elementary engineering courses. His years at UCF have given him the background knowledge and learning skills to contribute to the success of Group 24 and the creation of the SLIG. Christopher has been assigned the task of researching, selecting and designing for the different sensors the SLIG will require. His successful completion of both Electronics I and II and their accompanying laboratories have prepared Christopher to deal with the hardware components to the SLIG.</p>
