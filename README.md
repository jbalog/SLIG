This repository holds the source code of the Android mobile application for senior design project: Sign Language Interpreter Glove (SLIG)

The objective of the Sign Language Interpreter Glove (SLIG) project is to create a device that will aid in the communication barrier 
between vocal and sign language speakers. This project demonstrates the application of a glove equipped with multiple sensors such 
that it can be worn on a personâ€™s hand and has the ability to recognize the American Sign Language (ASL) signs performed by the user. 
Whatever sign the glove has recognized will be displayed through the designated user interface (Android Application). The project was 
chosen with two purposes in mind; the first being to help ASL speakers communicate with those who do not understand ASL and the second 
to help non-ASL speakers learn and practice signing.
